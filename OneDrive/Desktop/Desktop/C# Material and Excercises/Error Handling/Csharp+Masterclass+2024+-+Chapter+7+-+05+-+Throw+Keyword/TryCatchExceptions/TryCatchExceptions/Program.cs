        // What Does throw Do?
        // The throw keyword in C# is used to indicate that a problem
        // has occurred in your program
        // When you use throw, you're essentially saying,
        // "Hey, something went wrong here, and I can't handle it by myself." 
        // You're creating an error on purpose, which is called an exception.

        // Why use throw?
        /*
         * 1. To Stop Bad Things from Happening: If something in your program 
         * isn't right, like if a necessary file is missing or a number
         * that should never be zero is zero, using throw stops the program
         * before any more damage can happen.
         * 
         * 2. To Tell Other Parts of Your Program about the Problem: 
         * Sometimes, one part of your program might not know 
         * how to fix a problem, but another part does. By using throw,
         * the first part can let the second part handle the issue.
